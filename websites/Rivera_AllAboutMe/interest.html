			<p style="margin-top:25px;text-indent:4em;width:490px">Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows. Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. <br></p>

			<p style="margin-top:25px;text-indent:4em;width:490px">I enjoy playing this game by myself or sometimes, with friends. Just that satisfaction from doing good and playing well makes it addicting. Seeing my rank go up because of its highly competitive nature makes me so happy. Valorant is something that I'm good at, and seeing my skills improve every game makes me want to play again and again. This game is something that has made my lockdown days more bearable, and lead me to meet new friends.</p>

			<h1 style="text-align:center;">Playing the Guitar</h1>
			<img src="guitar_kurt.jpg" alt="Me playing the guitar" style="width:300px;border-radius:0;float:right;margin-top:40px">
			<p style="margin-top:50px;text-indent:4em;width:490px">I started playing the guitar when my brother started playing as well. At first, it was to impress people my age, because back then, when you could play the guitar, you were very popular. As time went by, I found playing the guitar enjoyable, and I didn't do it for others, I played and learned so I could impress myself. I was part of a band named "Parokya ni Ernie" and we joined the school's annual Battle of the Bands twice as 9th graders and seniors. Playing and being part of something bigger made me feel good. Today, I still play the guitar sometimes when I'm in the mood, but playing the guitar is forever one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
